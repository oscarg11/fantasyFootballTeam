Project Name: Fantasy Soccer
Stack: MERN
Overview: 
I will be creating a MERN Stack project that allows users to create a Fantasy
soccer team where they will be able to create a team name and select at least 11 
different players from an api. Once a team is created it will be displayed on the 
dashboard from a table that contains the team creator name and the team name that will be a
link to a team details page. Users will also be able to Update and delete their created team
Features:

#I plan on creating a Login and registration with validations
#Protected Routes
#BootStrap
#CRUD on a non user table. I may have to create a many to many relatioship
